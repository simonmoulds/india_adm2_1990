# IND_adm2_1990

Level 2 administrative boundaries for India circa 1990. This shapefile is a combination of FAO GAUL and GADM products for India.

## Notes

### Jammu & Kashmir

Administrative Atlas indicates that Samba was carved from Jammu and Kathua, but in fact it looks like the majority of the new district was taken from Jammu. Thus, I have simply merged Jammu and Samba to create the 2001 Jammu boundary.

Similarly, the Atlas states that Ramban was carved from Udhampur and Doda, but it seems that the largest portion of the new district comes from Doda. Again, I have merged Doda and Ramban to create the 2001 Doda boundary.

### Arunachal Pradesh

The border between East and West Kameng is different in the Administrative Atlas compared to GAUL/GADM. I haven't done anything about this.
